## Overview

The FarMart Invoice Management System is a database-backed application built using Java and SQL. Its primary function is to manage inventory, marketing, delivery, and sales operations, replacing the older paper filing system. This system helps track all invoice-related data, including customers, products, services, and sales totals, while also allowing users to generate detailed sales reports.

## Project Scope

The system aims to securely store and manage data for FarMart's sales operations. Users can produce customized reports that help track business performance. It covers:
- Customer and sales information
- Products, services, and equipment
- Invoice creation and management
- Secure storage of sensitive customer data using a MySQL/MariaDB database

## Key Components

### 1. **Database Design**
- The database is designed using MySQL/MariaDB with tables that store relationships between customers, products, services, and invoices.
- Data is structured to enforce unique constraints and relationships using primary and foreign keys.

### 2. **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**
- Provides a visual representation of how the entities (e.g., customers, products, invoices) are related within the database.

### 3. **Class Model**
- The system uses object-oriented principles such as inheritance, abstraction, and encapsulation to manage data entities.
- Classes are created to model objects and utilize inheritance for better design.

### 4. **Database Interface**
- Refactored to load data directly from the database using Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) instead of flat files.
- Reports are generated by querying the database.

### 5. **Data Structures**
- A linked list is implemented to order invoices by different criteria, such as customer name, invoice total, and store code.
- Custom comparators are used to sort and manage the data within the list.

### 6. **Testing and Refactoring**
- The system has undergone extensive testing to ensure accurate data representation and error-free reporting.
- The code was refactored multiple times to improve efficiency, for example, replacing linear searches with maps for faster data retrieval.

## Technologies Used

- **Java** (Object-Oriented Programming)
- **SQL/MySQL/MariaDB** (Database management)
- **JSON** (Data interchange)
- **JDBC** (Database connectivity)
- **Log4j** (Logging)

## Future Improvements

Further improvements could include better optimization for larger datasets, implementing additional reporting features, and extending functionality to other business operations like marketing or customer service.
